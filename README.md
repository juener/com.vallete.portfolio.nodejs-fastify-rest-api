# nodejs-fastify-rest-api

Since I have developed only private projects on the last years, I have decided to publish some basic projects to build my portfolio focused in Java, Node.JS and React.JS. The main goal is find some way to apply some of the most popular technologies using a simple way to introduce some fundamental resources.

> Please regard the "About" tab on the GitHub, which you are able to check the technologies used in this project.

> This project will not be deployed to give public endpoint for testing, however, it has all the resources to be deployed anytime using Node.JS 18 or newer. If you want to deploy that, please regard the notes.txt, which I usually provide some useful details. 

> Important note: since the Knex.js _https://knexjs.org/guide/#configuration-options_, it is just necessary to change the SQLite3 to a convencional database such as Postgresql or MariaDB in case you decide to deploy this project.
