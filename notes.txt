## first steps

### to init the package.json
npm init -y 

### since the nodejs doesn't support TS, make TS as development dependency
npm i -D typescript

### install the @types/node as development dependency
npm install -D @types/node

### instal the tsx as development dependency
npm install tsx -D

### create the tsconfig.json
npx tsc --init

### to get the new features, change in tsconfig.json
"target": "es2016" to "target": "es2020"

### we are going to use the fastify 
npm i fastify

### to use cookies 
npm i @fastify/cookie

### to use .env files
npm i dotenv

### to use zod
npm i zod

### let's run that
npx tsx src/server.ts

### or add the "dev": "tsx watch src/server.ts" to the package.json and just run
npm run dev


## for this project we are going to use knex + sqlite3

### install knex and its driver for sqlite3
### https://knexjs.org/guide/#configuration-options
npm install knex sqlite3

### add the script "knex": "node --no-warnings --loader tsx ./node_modules/.bin/knex" to the package.json and just run when you want to migrate
npm run knex -- migrate:make create-transactions

### run whenever the migration is ready to be deployed
npm run knex -- migrate:latest or npm run knex -- migrate:rollback


## tests

### we are going to use the vitest as development dependency
npm i vitest -D 

### add "test": "vitest" to the package.json and just run
npm run test

### install the supertest as development dependency 
npm i supertest -D
npm i -D @types/supertest


## deploy 

### since our code is TS, we got to convert it to JS to deploy that
npm i tsup -D

### add "build": "tsup src" to the package.json and just run 
npm run build
or use "build": "tsup src --out-dir build" to define another out directory

### besides I am not using the eslint for this project, I created the .eslintignore to ignore some folders
node_modules dist build
